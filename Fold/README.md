#FOLD

A small utitlity that extends the Nemo file manager in Linux Mint. 

Say you have a file, and you want to move it into a new folder with the same name. Instead of right-clicking and typing out or pasting the whole name, why not just right-click a select a command that automatically does that?

FOLD is a small utility that moves the selected file in a newly created similarly named folder.
